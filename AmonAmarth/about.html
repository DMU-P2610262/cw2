<p>One of the most respected and consistent forces in the melodic death metal
scene, Sweden's Amon Amarth emerged in the early '90s with a sound that infused
traditional scorched-earth Scandinavian death metal with Viking history and lore.
They broke into the mainstream in 2008 with the release of their landmark seventh
LP Twilight of the Thunder God, which charted both at home and abroad, paving the
way for subsequent triumphs like Deceiver of the Gods (2013) and Berserker (2019).</p>

<p>The seeds for the group were sewn in 1988 under the moniker Scum, which featured
vocalist Paul Mäkitalo (Dark Funeral), lead guitarist Olavi Mikkonen, bass player
Petri Tarvainen, and rhythm guitarist Vesa Meriläinen. Four years later a re-tooled
lineup consisting of vocalist Johan Hegg, guitarists Mikkonen and Anders Hansson,
bassist Ted Lundstrom, and drummer Niko Kaukinen began operating as Amon Amarth,
taking their name from the Sindarin translation of Mount Doom, the cursed volcano in J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy epic The Lord of the Rings. In 1993, the quintet recorded their first demo Thor Arise, which went unreleased due to sound problems; a second demo, Arrival of the Fimbul Winter, followed in 1994, quickly selling out all 1,000 copies. Signing to the Singapore-based Pulverised label, Amon Amarth issued the EP Sorrow Throughout the Nine Worlds in mid-1996; soon after, Kaukinen exited and was replaced by drummer Martin Lopez for 1998's full-length Once Sent from the Golden Hall. The LP, released via Metal Blade, helped establish the band as a force to be reckoned with in the death metal community. Hansson left shortly after the album's release, making way for new guitarist Johan Söderberg and drummer Fredrik Andersson, who made their studio debuts on 1999's Avenger -- this would prove to be the strongest and most prolific iteration of the group, lasting well into the 2010s.</p>

<p>The punishing and aptly named Crusher arrived in 2001, followed in 2002 by the
dark and melancholic Versus the World, the latter of which introduced a more measured,
bottom-heavy style. 2004's Fate of Norns continued in that vein, and was followed
in 2006 by With Oden on Our Side, which was the band's first album to enter the
Billboard charts. 2008's Twilight of the Thunder God became Amon Amarth's most
critically acclaimed and commercially successful outing to date, landing in the
Top Ten of numerous year-end lists. In 2011, the group released their eighth studio
album, Surtur Rising, followed by a world tour alongside metal luminaries Children of
Bodom and Ensiferum, among others. Deceiver of the Gods, which featured a guest
appearance by former Candlemass vocalist Messiah Marcolin, arrived in 2013.
Two years later saw the departure of longtime drummer Fredrik Andersson. The
band recruited session kit man Tobias Gustafsson for 2016's Jomsviking, and
tapped Jocke Wallgren as the official replacement shortly thereafter. Wallgren
made his studio debut on Amon Amarth's 11th long-player, 2019's Berserker.</p>
